I made a site for my friend plumber. I used html, css, query, and javascript to make the site, and PHP script to receive applications from the site to a mail. The site is responsive and has different animations. We a little used template from "figma", the rest of it we came up ourselves.

Link to the site:

ps: the alert (after clicking a button in the form) is sending a strange message because github doesn't have servers. all displayed correctly on a friend's site
